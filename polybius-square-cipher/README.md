## Getting Started

This code represents a Polibius Square Cipher. The table used in this code is displayed below:

## How the Cipher works

You take the first leter, find the row and then the column and output the pair of numbers. Here is an example below:

Input :  jake
Output : 24112515

j = 24 , a = 11 , k = 25 , e = 15

## Disclaimer
This is a simple use case of this cipher and the code could use more polish. Feel free to take this and build on top of it.
